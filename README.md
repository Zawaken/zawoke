# zawoke
Trying my hand at doing a complete rewrite of my discord bot.
Invite link: [Zawoke/Ram](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=319005959022313483&scope=bot&permissions=2146958591)
## To run this bot:

You can git clone the repo and run it with `python3 alpha.py` in the `/src` directory.

Or you can set it up with docker/docker-compose
```
docker build -t zawoke .
docker-compose up
```

Just remember to `cp ./src/example_secrets.json ./src/secrets.json` and add your bot token.
